# machine-language-translation
The project is about translation of german langauge to english langauge using neural network

Machine Translation is the next step to cancel out the differences among different languages .This project has a power point presentation describing the journey to the present level technology used in machine language translation.Also all the version required are mentioned  in the version.py. The project trains on the dataset provided by first splitting it into training and testing set and the model used for it was LSTM-long short term memory.

LSTM ensures that if any word used at start is of a particular tense then it is carried forward to make the words in future to set according to the tense used
